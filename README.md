Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about web development and creating interactive, data-driven applications. I recently worked on a React.js dashboard project, and I'm excited to share it with you.

### Project: React.js Dashboard

**Project Repository:** https://github.com/FahmiEqubal/equbalfahmi-dashboard/

#### Project Description

In my latest project, I've developed a dynamic dashboard using React.js. This dashboard provides users with a comprehensive overview of important data and statistics. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

- **Sidebar**: A sleek sidebar that offers easy navigation to various sections of the dashboard.

- **Header**: The header section is designed for quick access and identification. It displays the user's name on the left, and on the right, there's a handy search box for finding specific data.

- **Dashboard Data Containers**: In the lower part of the dashboard, you'll find four containers, each presenting essential data and statistics. These containers give users a clear snapshot of the most crucial information.

- **Bar Graph**: One of the containers showcases a bar graph, which visualizes data fetched from (https://dummyjson.com/). This graph offers insights into your data in an engaging and informative manner.

- **Doughnut Chart**: In another container, there's a captivating doughnut chart that presents data in a visually appealing format. It provides a different perspective on the information at hand.

- **Product Sales Table**: At the bottom of the dashboard, there's a table that displays detailed information about product sales. It's a convenient way to view and analyze sales data.

I'm continually working to enhance and improve this project, and I welcome any feedback or contributions. Feel free to explore the project repository for more details and to get involved in its development.
